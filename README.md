# Born-4-2beroot
System Administrator Diary
This is my guide through the essential concepts and steps to completing 42 project Born2beroot with Rocky Linux.

<a href="https://rockylinux.org/">Rocky Linux</a> is a distribution that stems from CentOS since its discontinued development. The original co-founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS">CentOS</a> took on the responsability of carrying on the initial goal of a community-driven, enterprise level operating system for development. The project is now hosted by <a href="https://www.resf.org/about">Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation</a>.

Rocky established itself as a downstream build of its upstream vendor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>.
